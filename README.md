Teebot is a tshirt folding robot that uses servos and a 4-panel system to fold tshirts. This robot was inspired by Sheldon from TBBT who used a platic contraption to fold his TShirts. Teebot offers two modes; the first is the 'single' mode which can be used to fold tshirts out one-by-one. The 'loop' mode, on the other hand, asks the user for the number of tshirts the user would like to fold and runs the folding mechanism multiple times till all the tshirts are folded. 

Configuring the Oled+keypad system and rigging up the laying out mechanism posed some difficulty. Here are the materials I used:
1. SG90 Servo x 9
2. Arduino Uno R3
3. 5V phone charger x 1
4. 9V batteries x inf
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper wires
7. Cardboard
8. Tape
9. 128x64 i2c Oled
10.  Keypad 4x4

Tools: Soldering Iron, X-acto knife, Wire stripper etc.
   
Creating the hardware without access to any 3d modelling tools and printer was a challenge. The hardware is composed entirely of cardboard and tape, so not the most sturdy.
